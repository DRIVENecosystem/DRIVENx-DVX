# Melon

![](../.gitbook/assets/gitbook-melon.png)

## What is Melon?

Melon is the second project of the DRIVENecosystem; it is a charity initiative that was created specifically to help women all over the world who are currently battling breast cancer. We sincerely hope they succeed. 

## What is the mission of the Melon?

Our mission is to create a cryptocurrency donation platform to assist over 2,500 women in their fight against breast cancer. Development of this application has already begun, and expect to be done by the end of this year. 

We have the ability to make a genuine difference for the larger good, rather than just for ourselves. We remind ourselves of our responsibility to make the world a better place for everyone by donating to those in need.

On each transaction, 1.5 percent of the built-in tokenomics is transferred into a charity wallet, from which we donate to women with breast cancer. So far, we have made six donations to people, which you can find  on our [website](https://melontokenbsc.com/).
