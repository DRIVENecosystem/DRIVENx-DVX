## What is DRIVENx token?

DRIVENx is the primary token in the DRIVEN ecosystem. It is a BEP20 token released on the Binance Smart Chain Network in June of 2021. Our focus is on bridging the gaps between cryptocurrency and standard FIAT-based business as usual. 

DRIVENx token is a deflationary version of the DRIVENprotocol token. DRIVENx is created specifically for our DRIVEN-branded exchange and will allow us to use liquidity mining and staking functions on it.

## What is the mission of the DRIVENx?

We are developing a platform that will allow businesses to conduct all of their existing transactions with regard to their customers' supply chain using cryptocurrency.

The platform will allow businesses to pay or receive funds for goods and/or services without having to convert their cryptocurrency to fiat currency, thereby avoiding costly foreign exchange fees and price fluctuations.

They can use our service as an intermediary broker to pay or receive the cryptocurrency of their choice and transact in a peer-to-peer manner.

## What is the B2B platform? 

The DRIVENtrade platform will serve as a gathering place for business owners looking to transition from the stone age of web 1.0 style online transacting to the modern methodology of using digital encrypted currency to stay current with the latest tech trends and future standards.

When we launch our DRIVENtrade platform, it will function as a marketplace for businesses to purchase directly from suppliers and/or distributors. There will be a large database of available goods and services with early adopters who use our service, while we keep an open door for new vendors looking to list their goods and services.

## What is DRIVENxchange?

DRIVENxchange is a DRIVEN-branded DEX designed specifically for tokens created by the DRIVENteam; the main token used on this exchange is DRIVENx.

DRIVENxchange, like PancakeSwap, has a slew of DeFi functions. DRIVENxhcange is an automated market maker \(AMM\) that allows users to trade cryptocurrency without the need for an order book. DRIVENxchange users may earn money via staking, contributing to liquidity pools, and yield farming.

## What is liquidity mining?

Liquidity mining, also known as yield farming, is the act of providing liquidity via cryptocurrencies to decentralized exchanges \(DEXs\). Since the primary goal of an exchange is to be liquid, DEXs seek to reward users willing to bring capital to their platform.

## What is staking?

Staking is the process of actively engaging in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake \(PoS\) blockchain \(similar to crypto mining\). Anyone with a minimum needed amount of a DRIVENx can validate transactions and receive Staking rewards on these blockchains.

## DRIVENprotocol to DRIVENx migration?

Every holder who purchased DRIVENprotocol before June 1st will receive a 1:1 ratio migration to DRIVENx.   
  
At the time of DRIVENx's launch, the top 100 holders received 15% of DRIVENprotocol tokens migrated to DRIVENx, while everyone else received 20%.

Every 7 days DRIVENprotocol holders will get 10% migrated until we migrate the entire amount. 

DRIVENprotocol token holders are expected to maintain their tokens during the migration process; otherwise, your tokens will not be transferred to DRIVENx.
