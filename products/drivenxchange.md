## What is DRIVENswap?

DRIVENswap is a DRIVEN-branded DEX designed specifically for tokens created by the DRIVENteam; the main token used on this exchange is DRIVENx.

DRIVENswap, like Pancakeswap, has a slew of DeFi functions. DRIVEN is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to trade cryptocurrency without the need for an order book. DRIVENswap users may earn money via staking, contributing to liquidity pools, and yield farming.

## **What is yield farming?** 

Yield farming also referred to as liquidity mining, is a way to generate rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. It is simply a way for you to earn more by locking your cryptocurrency asset.

## What is staking?

Staking is the process of actively engaging in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain (similar to crypto mining). Anyone with a minimum needed amount of a DRIVENx can validate transactions and receive Staking rewards on these blockchains.
