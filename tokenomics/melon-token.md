# MELONx Token

**Melon \($MLN\)** is a deflationary and community-driven token that aids women all over the world in their fight against breast cancer. It is the DRIVENecosystem's charity token.

Melon was **launched on** **May 28th 2021.** A **fair-launch** for the community was our priority. Therefore, Melon started with a market cap of only $50,000.

Together with our community we decided to migrate to better and improved contract for the Melon via the Telegram voting pool. On **August 13th we launched a V2 version of the Melon token.**

The supply of the updated Melon is **100,000,000,000** tokens

## MELONx

New Melon contract was a significant improvement for Melon because the new contract allowed us to collect funds for marketing and donations in BUSD \(BEP20\), which means that we can make donations to women with breast cancer without crashing the price of the actual Melon, which was preventing us from making regular donations when the price was low. We will also be able to undertake frequent marketing promotions with the new contract. 

Our objective for the new MELONx contract was to make it more appealing to hold for the long term, therefore we decided to allocate a larger amount of tokenomics specifically for redistribution to holders, so Melon holders will receive token rewards for holding the Melon in BUSD \(BEP20\).

## **MELONx Tokenomics**

Melon ****is a **deflationary token**, which means that its total supply decreases with each token transaction. As with every transfer, a portion of the transferred amount is burned, added to liquidity pool, redistributed to holders, and placed in the charity wallet. 

We decided to take a different approach to taxation, and as a result, we chose to raise taxes within the first two weeks of the Melon launch to prevent large price fluctuations and to reward long-term investors.

### Schedule of tax changes

Melon token will have 30% tax for the first 7 days, then 25% for the next 7 days after the launch.

On August 27th we will reduce taxes to 20%

On September 27th, we will have 18% taxes, and on October 27th, we will have 15% taxes forever.

**Tokenomics that will be used in the first week:**

* 2% burned
* 6% added to liquidity pool
* 10% placed in marketing/charity wallet
* 12% redistributed to holders 

**Tokenomics that will be used in the second week:**

* 1% burned
* 4% added to liquidity pool
* 9% placed in marketing/charity wallet
* 11% redistributed to holders
