## Background

Blockchain networks enable the quick, secure, transfer, and production of digital products, as well as the storage and execution of tamper-proof programs capable of managing digital assets. Once deployed on-chain, these programs cannot be modified and are open to everyone with access to the chain. They execute depending on the defined parameters and interactions \(transactions\) and are verified by the blockchain's consensus process. These features enable anonymous parties to enter into legally enforceable digital contracts known as smart contracts.

The Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) powers DRIVENx smart contract, which is a rich and expanding digital asset ecosystem driven by Binance DEX, the leading decentralized exchange.
